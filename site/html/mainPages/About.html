		A lot of people have commented on how smart I must be since I know a lot of things. In truth I don't know a lot about any one thing, instead I know smattherings about several things. My grandfather, with his multiple PhD's, use to say that an ex is somthing that you don't want any more and that a suprt is a drip of water. So why on earth would you want to be an expert when it's just a discared drip of water? </p>
	<p>
		With that said I am just someone who is fairly curious about most things and like to explore topics and talk to people who do know about a topic.  Meaning that I realy truly do just know a smathering of things.

		I am an American journlist, photographer, and artist. I hold a BA from Drury Unvieristy with a mjor in Multimedia Journlism and Production and minors in Web Communications and Design as well as in Math. I also have an AAS from Rochester Community and Technical College in Art. A bit of an odd combitation but it works for me.
	</p>
	<p> I also hold a certification in Web Design from the Univerity of Michigan that I abotianed through Coursera. Why do I have this you might ask? Simple really couristy; everything also comes down to couristy.</p>
	<p>
		Before becoming a journlist I spent eight years as a proffessional dancer. From the ages 15 to 22 I danced in mutilple fairs and festivels as an Irish dancer and clogger for the first five years of my career and then thaught the other three years. I have also done a liturgical dance for a number of churches over the years. I started dancing at the age of 3 and have spent the rest of my life embracing all kinds of dance.

		I am decently techy, have a odd sense of humor, enjoy a number of different things, admittedly an a bit of a geek and am in a long term deeply commited realationship with coffee.
