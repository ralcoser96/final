<h2>A Minnesotan: Perspective shift
</h2>
	<h3>By RosaLin Alcoser
</h3>
	<p>
		Perspective is a funny thing. It was just a year ago now that I spent the 4th of July with a friend in Southern Missouri discussing how hot it was on a 100 something degree day as we headed off to go swimming. Now one year later I’m in Northern Minnesota having weekly arguments with a co-worker that just because the temperature is over 70 degrees does not make it hot outside. 

	</p>
	<p>Yes, there have been a few 80 degree days up here this year that have boarded on being hot, but not what I have gotten used to as hot and definitely not what my mother would consider being hot. It is definitely a perspective thing as right now with temperatures sitting in the upper ‘70s and just started to wear shorts and short-sleeved shirts. The neighbourhood children, on the other hand, started swimming in the lake a few weeks ago when it got past 65. </p>
	<p>I do release that it was not that long ago that I firmly believed as all Minnesota children do, that anything above 65 degrees is in fact swimming weather. Now that belief has shifted and I feel like the water is way too cold when the air is in the mid-’60s. I have been bold enough to wade in the water on some of the warmer days in the mid to upper ‘70s. </p>

<p>The current plan is to give it another week to be warm and then be brave enough to go swimming instead of just wading. </p>
	<p>My only concussion as to the why of this change in belief is that my perspective on what hot is changed when I got used to my last environment or my last environment made me weak to cooler weather.
